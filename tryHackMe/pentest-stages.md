# TryHackMe – Penetration Testing Stages (Lab Notes)

## 1. Rules of Engagement
- Permission: írásos engedély a cégtől.
- Scope: meghatározza, mi van és mi nincs tesztben.
- Rules: engedélyezett/nem engedélyezett technikák.

## 2. Information Gathering
- OSINT: publikus adatok (LinkedIn, email címek, céges infók).
- Példa: Abbey Feltwood LinkedIn → email: a.feltwood@acme.co.uk

## 3. Enumeration & Scanning
- Cél: teljes kép a rendszerről (IP, szolgáltatások, portok).
- Lab IP: `96.37.50.151`
- Eredmény: Web: Yes, Login: No
- Parancs példa:
```bash
nmap -sV 96.37.50.151

I scanned the IP and discovered that a web service was accessible.
This step clearly showed how enumeration bridges the gap between reconnaissance and exploitation.

## 4. Exploitation
The next phase was to **exploit discovered vulnerabilities**.
The aim here is to gain access to the target system using the weaknesses identified earlier.

In the lab, I exploited a vulnerable web service and successfully opened a Meterpreter session:
```bash
exploit -k -z
# Meterpreter session 1 opened

5. Post Exploitation


Once access was established, the focus shifted to post exploitation.

The main goals at this stage were:

Maintaining access to the system,

Privilege escalation (from a normal user to an administrator),

Accessing sensitive files and critical functionalities,

Potentially pivoting to other systems within the same network.



This phase highlighted that exploitation is only the beginning — real value lies in what an attacker can do after gaining access.

6. Reporting & Clearing Up


The final stage was about creating the pentest report and cleaning up the environment.

As a penetration tester, it’s my responsibility to:

Document all findings (vulnerabilities, exploitation steps, and mitigation advice),

Provide the client with a clear report they can use to fix the issues,

Remove any artifacts or access methods left behind during the test.
