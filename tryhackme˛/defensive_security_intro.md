# TryHackMe – Defensive Security Intro

## Overview
This room introduced the daily workflow of a Junior SOC Analyst, covering the detection, validation, escalation, and containment of incidents.

## Key Steps
1. **SIEM Detection** – Identified suspicious SSH login attempts from IP `143.110.250.149`.
2. **OSINT Validation** – Confirmed as malicious (100% confidence, China Mobile Communications).
3. **Escalation** – Forwarded the case to the SOC Team Lead for response.
4. **Firewall Action** – Blocked the malicious IP on the network perimeter.

## Tools & Skills Learned
- SIEM log analysis
- OSINT IP reputation lookup
- Incident escalation process
- Firewall block rules

## Conclusion
This exercise simulated a complete incident response cycle for a SOC Analyst.
Key takeaway: detection is only valuable if followed by validation and proper response.
